checkRow:
takes number $a0, $a1 - row number,

add 0xffff8000 to some register t6
add 9 to some register: t5
multiply 9 by $a1, store in t5
add t5 to t6
create a counter variable t7
if t7 > 8, number is not in row
lb at t6 into a register t3
check if $a0 == $t3, if it is then number is in row
otherwise add 1 to t6
add 1 to t7
loop

checkColumn:
takes number $a0, $a2 - col number
add 0xffff8000 to some register t6
add $a2 to $t6
create a counter variable t7
if t7 > 8, number is not in row
lb at t6 into t3
check if t3 == $a0, if it is then number is in row
otherwise add 9 to t6
add 1 to t7
loop

for example
row = 1, column = 1
check if % row/3 == 0 (divisble by 3 or 0) 
check if $ col/3 == 0 (divisible by 3 or 0)
1 is not divisble by 3, so subtract 1 from row and column
check that sum of row and column is divisble by 3
if it is, then you have reached the start of the subgrid

1, 1
since both are not divisble by 1, subtract 1 from both
0,0
both divisble by 3 and sum is divisble by 3, so 0,0 is start of subgrid

----------
mult row no by 9
add it to 0xffff8000
add col - start to 
------

example:

row = 5 column = 6

is row divisible by 3? no so subtract 1
is column divisble by 3? yes so do nothing
row - 1 = 4 is div by 3? no so subtract 1
row - 1 = 3 is div by 3? yes so done 
check if sum is div by 3. 6 + 3 = 9  is div by 3? yes so 3,6 is start of subgrid
